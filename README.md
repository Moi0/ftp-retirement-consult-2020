Subject: Retirement of the IETF FTP service

Hello!

Thank you for all of the feedback on the proposal to retire the IETF FTP service.  The robust mailing list discussion not only illuminated the community's perspective on the FTP services but also the workflows used to participate in the IETF.  A summary of the thread can be found at [1].

After reviewing all of the public and private feedback, the IESG endorses the retirement of the IETF FTP service.  The IESG deliberation centered on:

** The cost of maintaining the FTP service as borne by the Tools Team;

** The size of the population using the FTP service;

** The loss of access to IETF assets if the FTP service was not present; and

** Unique workflows or populations that FTP enabled.

The IESG acknowledges that community support for this decision is not unanimous.  Based on specific feedback, a few clarifications and changes have been made to the approach to retiring the service.  See the revised plan [2] (as diffs from original [3]).   Additionally, the IESG has confirmed that the offer from volunteers at Carnegie Mellon University to help with any script conversion is still available [4].

Again, thank you for the feedback.  In the coming months, the IESG plans to work with the Tools Team and community members to complete the "Actions" and "Next Steps" sections of [3], including announcing a 4-month migration period to allow for the porting of scripts and associated workflows, prior to the retirement of the service.

Regards,

Roman

(as the IESG tools representative)

Subject: RE: Call for Community Feedback: Retiring IETF FTP Service

The community feedback period on retiring the FTP service has come to close.  Thank you for all of input in the almost 400 messages across several threads.  The full history can be found in the mail archive (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/oTleIrHnjuvtEUKjpPXCt4Q31Qw/) and a running summary of key themes, positions and lines of discussion was also made (https://github.com/ietf/ftp-retirement-consult-2020/blob/main/status.md).

IESG will need some time to fully review all of the input, and we will return to the community on the topic in the coming weeks.

Subject: Call for Community Feedback: Retiring IETF FTP Service

The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is seeking community input on retiring the IETF FTP service (ftp://ftp.ietf.org, ftp://ops.ietf.org, ftp://ietf.org).  A review of this service has found that FTP appears to serve a very small community and HTTP has become the access mechanism of choice.  Given this shift in community usage, reducing the operational complexity of the overall IETF infrastructure seems to outweigh the very limited community served with FTP.  

In reviewing the additional impacts of such a service retirement, the dependencies on FTP have been assessed.  Additionally, it has been confirmed that all information currently reachable through FTP will continue to be available through other services (HTTP, RSYNC, IMAP).

In consultation with the Tools team (Robert, Glen, Henrik, Russ, and Alexey), Communications team (Greg), affected SDO liaisons, IAB Chair, and LLC ED, a proposed retirement plan was developed and is available at:

https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/Retiring_IETF_FTP_Service.pdf

The IESG appreciates any input from the community on this proposal and will consider all input received by December 4, 2020 (to account for the upcoming IETF 109 and holidays).
