Subject: Call for Community Feedback: Retiring IETF FTP Service

The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is seeking community input on retiring the IETF FTP service (ftp://ftp.ietf.org, ftp://ops.ietf.org, ftp://ietf.org).  A review of this service has found that FTP appears to serve a very small community and HTTP has become the access mechanism of choice.  Given this shift in community usage, reducing the operational complexity of the overall IETF infrastructure seems to outweigh the very limited community served with FTP.  

In reviewing the additional impacts of such a service retirement, the dependencies on FTP have been assessed.  Additionally, it has been confirmed that all information currently reachable through FTP will continue to be available through other services (HTTP, RSYNC, IMAP).

In consultation with the Tools team (Robert, Glen, Henrik, Russ, and Alexey), Communications team (Greg), affected SDO liaisons, IAB Chair, and LLC ED, a proposed retirement plan was developed and is available at:

https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/Retiring_IETF_FTP_Service.pdf

The IESG appreciates any input from the community on this proposal and will consider all input received by December 4, 2020 (to account for the upcoming IETF 109 and holidays).
